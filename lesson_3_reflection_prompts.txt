When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   This would be best in cases where we would like to work collaboratively with other developers
   Also, it is usefull to keep a copy of the code online to be able to access it from anywhere
   Finally, it creates an external backup of the code which may come in handy if local files are
   lost or become corrupted.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
