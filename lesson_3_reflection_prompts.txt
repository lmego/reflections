When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   This would be best in cases where we would like to work collaboratively with other developers
   Also, it is usefull to keep a copy of the code online to be able to access it from anywhere
   Finally, it creates an external backup of the code which may come in handy if local files are
   lost or become corrupted.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
	To retain control of the changes being made, while they are being made. Otherwise, code  added by 
	other remote users may affect the changes that a local user may be working on, therefore, rendering
	those changes useless.
		
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork: Creates a copy of an existing public repository in GitHub to a users' own GIThub account. This
	allows the user to make and store changes and commits to his own remote copy of the repository. As he 
	most likely will not have the permissions to make changes on the original repository.
	
	Clone: Makes a copy of GIThub repository to a users local computer. It then links the local repository
	to the remote repository from which the information was clone, in order to be able to continue to pull
	and or push changes to/from the remote repository. It can also be used to create a local copy of the 
	entire repository
	
	Branch: Creates a snapshot in time of all the files in the repository and a secondary "path" on which
	changes can be made and committed in the existing repository. Any changes made in a secondary branch
	do not impact those made on the "master" branch. Therefore it is very useful to implement test or 
	experimental feature without affecting the main code.
