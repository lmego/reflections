How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped by allowing to perform a line by line comparison of the files
    This quickly highlighted the difference between the files minimizing time
    needed to find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Yes. This could allow me to compare current code to older versions to ensure
    consistency in the code and locate solutions to bugs that arose from changes
    
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that you are able to decide when to record a specific change
    on your code that you may want to track specifically in the future
    The major con is that if one does not get into the habit of doing a manual
    commit, then users may forget and when they finally perform a commit, it 
    may actually be meaningless.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Meant for programmers. Meant to track changes on files that are somewhat
    interrelated and that affect multiple files at a time.
